# no-make

This example uses BASH scripts to build the library and the application.

There are no make files or build tools required, the BASH scripts assemble 
all the options for gcc and ar to create the library archive file and the 
application executable.

Execute the build.sh script to do the complete build of the library and 
application.

> ./build.sh

The end result should be the helloworld executable.

> ./helloworld
