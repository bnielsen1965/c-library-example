# cmake

This example uses CMakeLists.txt files to describe how to create the Makefiles 
to build the library and the application.

The CMakeLists.txt in the my-library folder describes the my-library library 
while the CMakeLists.txt in the main cmake folder describes the application.

Create a build directory where the library and application will be compiled 
and change into that directory.

> mkdir build
> cd build

In the build directory call cmake with a reference to the previous directory.

> cmake ..

If successful the build folder now include a Makefile as well as all the 
resources generated by cmake to complete the build. Now execute make to 
build the library and application.

> make

At this point you should have the helloworld executable.

> ./helloworld
